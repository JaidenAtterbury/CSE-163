Group 049 CSE 163 Project Code:
Authors: Jaiden Atterbury and Tanner Huck
Date: 05/29/2023
Development Environment: VScode

# Can the code run directly in the Ed workspace?:
No, the following code and output does not completely run in the Ed workspace,
it only runs about half of the program before running out of memory. The code
is stored in the cse163projectcode.py file while the other files are either data
and/or program output.

# Does the code pass flake8?:
Yes running the command flake8 cseprojectcode.py returns no stlye errors.

# Where to find the data and what packages to use:
The data needed to run the code is everything in the geo_data folder as well
as the LifeExp.csv. All of those files are included in the workspace. Furthermore,
all necessary packages should be in the included environment, however, you may need
to install statsmodels and/or plotly if those aren't already included.

# Where to find the visualizations and output from the report?:
All of the necessary output in the report is printed out when the script is run.
Furthermore all of the plots are also included in this workspace. Most importantly,
the interactive visualizations that we couldn't show in the report are in this
workspace and should be saved to an html when the script is run. All of the plots
are also saved to pngs. Lastly, relevant csv outputs are also included in the workspace.

# Where to find the testing file:
There is no explicit testing file but this is for a good reason, which is explained in depth in the
report as follows: "Given that our project was much like assessment 4 and 6 in which testing was not
possible, testing our code proved to be a challenge for our group. Thus, with a little inspiration
from statistics and the TAs in office hours, we found different ways to ensure that our code
was accurate. The main ways we tested were through the use of statistical tests, as explained
in the multiple linear regression results section, and through the use of matching the expected
value of our plots with the data they were plotting to ensure our plotting functions were working
correctly."
