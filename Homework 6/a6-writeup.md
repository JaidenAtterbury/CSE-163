# Food Desert Analysis

## What is one way that government officials could use `plot_food_access_by_county` or `plot_low_access_tracts` to shape public policy on how to improve food
## access?
One way that government officials could use `plot_food_access_by_county` or `plot_low_access_tracts` to shape public policy on how to improve food access is
by using the maps to pinpoint what areas in Washington are impacted the most by inaccessibility to affordable and nutritious food. In particular, they could
use `plot_food_access_by_county` to find the specific counties that suffer the most from specific types of inaccessibility. For example, if they were most
interested in the low-income population that don't have access to affordable and nutritious food within a ten mile radius than they'd look at the plot in the
bottom left. Furthermore, if they were instead only focused on the tracts that have low access without caring about the certain breakdowns of distance and
income, than they'd look at `plot_low_access_tracts` to figure this information out.

## What is a limitation or concern with using the plots in this way?
The main limitation with using the plots as descirbed above, is that they don't give you much information on the specific towns or streets in which these types
of inaccessibility are most prevelant. Instead, these plots give very broad breakdowns of where in the state there is or is not low access areas. Furthermore,
these visualizations ignore the fact that some remote areas cannot feasibly have nearby access to food. Lastly, these visualiations also don't take into account
the people who don't see this inaccessibility as a problem.
